# A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates

_Rare, requires attunement_

This 600-page book of random numbers written by the RAND Corporation has powerful abilities that allow you to alter the future in a limited capacity.

When you are attuned to this item and finish a long rest, pick the next number from the list and cross it off. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with this roll as long as you are attuned to the book. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

The foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

_"Very interesting, starts off slow but picks up and is great until the end, which doesn't match up." -some scientist at the Loop_
